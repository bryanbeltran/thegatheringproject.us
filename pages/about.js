      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>In a world where people feel increasingly disconnected, we believe belonging shouldn’t be rare or conditional. Our goal is simple: connect our friends with your friends to spark real connection and deepen belonging in the places that shape our communities.</p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>We host a series of gatherings designed to foster belonging through shared experiences. Our gatherings make it easy for people to meet and connect deeply. We partner with like-minded venues, organizations, brands, and other communities to create spaces where connection thrives.</p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>Guided by our values of Connection Driven, Resource Exchange, and Catalyzing Space, we aim to turn friends into community and communities into resources. Through our Gathering Project, we also offer a cohort experience for people who want to host, connect, and create belonging together.</p>
